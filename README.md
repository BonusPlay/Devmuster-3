# Devmuster #3 hackathon repo
This is my team's project repo. Uploading it for archive and sharing purposes. It may not contain the latest files that we showed on hackathon (you know, it's hackathon - last second code updates). It also may contain some gettho workarounds (like not asking for android premissions and just expect that application has them - again, hackathon).

# What is it?
This application allows you quickly to request help at your location and shortens the amount of time required to spend on talking to the call center.
 - Send event data in JSON over SMS to the SMSGateway
 - SMSGateway sends it to server using REST API
 - Data is viewable and modifiable from web client
